This repository contains the 3rd Deep Learning coursework from the Department of Computing, Imperial College London, Academic Year 2019-2020, delivered by Professor Michael Bronstein, Professor Bjorn Schuller, and Stefanos Zafeirou. The coursework was developed with their PhD students. 

# RNNs
This task constituted of the implementation of RNN, LSTM and GRU uni-directional and bi-directional cells using the Pytorch library. <br>

The networks were used to classify audio recording of the numbers "one", "two" and "three" from Google Speech Commands. A maximal classification accuracy of 94% was reached developing a uni-directional GRU. An attention meachanism was applied to each signal sequences' hidden states to perfrom the final classification.

Please find a more precise description of the task and in depth answers to theoretical questions in the RNNS.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.
