# RNNs
This task constituted of the implementation of RNN, LSTM and GRU uni-directional and bi-directional cells using the Pytorch library. <br>
The networks were used to classify audio recording of the numbers "one", "two" and "three" from Google Speech Commands. A maximal classification accuracy of 94% was reached developing a uni-directional GRU. An attention meachanism was applied to each signal sequences' hidden states to perfrom the final classification. <br>
Please find a more precise description of the task and answers to theoretical questions in the RNNS.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.
